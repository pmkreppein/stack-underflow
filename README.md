This is a repo for two of my Flatiron School portfolio projects.  The master branch contains code for the version that uses pure Rails 5, the "rails-js-portfolio-project" branch contains the code for my Rails/JS Portfolio project.

To run the app, clone the repo, run rake db:migrate, run the server with 'rails s'
